# Remindly

Hallo people, this is a native programming project I am working on codenamed `myapp` which is a payment reminder app.

You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators.

I have used Visual Studio Code as the IDE, and I have used **Expo Snack**, an open source platform to run this app made with the **React Native** framework, which is written a special blend of JavaScript and HTML  called as **JSX**.

Now I have moved my main IDE to Webstorm, developed by JetBrains, due to superior tools and enhanced learning environment.

This app is currently still under work in progress... give it some time, and it might be released as an actual app on the Play Store. Sorry iOS users, but this app is currently untested or debugged on any iPhone yet.

**Just give it some time**.
